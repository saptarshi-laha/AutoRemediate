# Welcome to AutoRemediate!
AutoRemediate is a one-stop client-server driven solution to combat persistent Adware, Malware or other general infections without needing to re-image the system.
It is designed to remove persistence mechanisms from registry keys, startup locations, launcher daemon processes, etc. 
Yara can also be utilised for pinpoint accuracy in detecting/confirming malicious artefacts prior to termination/deletion.

# System Support
Currently under development but supports all three major Operating Systems
 - **Windows**
 - **Linux**
 - **macOS**

## Client-Server Driven Architecture for Single Use Script Generation
The remediation script is generated for one time use only. This allows a subscribed client to gain access to further remediations while preventing unsubscribed clients from utilising the product past the expiry date.

## Custom Rules
Create your own rules which you can then deploy with ease to everyone subscribed to AutoRemediate for your clients.
Rules can easily be added to the existing list or updated for an up to date remediation experience. YES! You can utilise YARA rules too!

## Progress
Currently working on implementing secure communication between Client-Server and implementing single-use functionality.


## Estimated Completion Date
End of November 2022. This could however be delayed a lot of factors.
